<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Flameling Queens](https://0x52.buyholdearn.com/title.png?raw=true)

This repository contains the code for the cross-chain NFT collection "Flameling Queens". The collection consists of 52 unique AI-generated images known as "Flameling Queens". Each suit, like a deck of cards, holds its own Queen. Her image is reflected in each matching suit. The Queens have their own unique look and a matching song, performed by recording artist, Layla. 

The repo includes code for generating the collection for upload on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), for testing and deploying the NFT smart contracts, and the frontend for the minting dapp.

Code is divided into three directories:

**[Artwork](./artwork):**
Code to generate the NFT collection for upload on IPFS

**[Smart Contracts](./contracts):**
Code to test and deploy the NFT cross-chain smart contracts based on ERC721A standard

**[Frontend](./frontend):**
Code for the mintig dApp using Nextjs, Wagmi, and TailwindCSS (deployed on Vercel)
